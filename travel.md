# Travel

Flights can be scheduled to the [Detroit Metro Airport (DTW)](https://www.metroairport.com/) or the [Capital Region International Airport (LAN)](https://www.flylansing.com/) in Lansing.

From Detroit, the [Michigan Flyer/AirRide shuttle](https://www.michiganflyer.com/) can be arranged, which is an affordable and convenient mode of transportation to Michigan State. Travel time on the bus is about 1 hour. Alternatively, you might want to rent a car at DTW.

The Lansing airport is an approximately 15-minute drive from the Michigan State University campus.

If you need an official invitation letter for any reason, contact us (on slack or via email), and we can send you one. Please include all of the organizers when you do to make sure that we see your message quickly!
