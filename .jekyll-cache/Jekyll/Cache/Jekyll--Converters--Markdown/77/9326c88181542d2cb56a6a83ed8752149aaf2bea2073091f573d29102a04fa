<p>You can use <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/1085+S+University+Ave,+Ann+Arbor,+MI+48109/">Google Maps</a> or the <a href="https://campusinfo.umich.edu/building-search/building/163/west-hall">University of Michigan Campus Map</a> to find directions to the building.</p>

<h2 id="transportation">Transportation</h2>

<p>Flights should be scheduled to the <a href="http://www.metroairport.com">Detroit Metro Airport</a> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DTW</code>). From there, a taxi or <a href="http://www.michiganflyer.com">Michigan Flyer/AirRide</a> shuttle can be arranged. The Michigan Flyer, in particular, is affordable and convenient.</p>

<p>Unless you are staying directly in Downtown Ann Arbor or the University of Michigan campus area, you will want to to arrange transportation. Rental cars can obtained from the airport, but all major brands also have Ann Arbor locations for pick up and drop off. Several taxi services are available. If you’re near a route you can also ride the <a href="http://www.theride.org">excellent local bus service</a>.</p>

<p>There is very little chance of street parking on weekdays on the University campus, but there is a <a href="https://pts.umich.edu/parking/structureforest.php">public parking structure</a> nearby on Forest Street.</p>
