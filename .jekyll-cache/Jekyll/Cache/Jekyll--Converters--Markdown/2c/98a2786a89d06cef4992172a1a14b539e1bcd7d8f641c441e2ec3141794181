<ul>
  <li><strong>May 1, 2019:</strong> First drafts of book chapters should be submitted. These need not be formatted, but should be more substantial than an abstract and suitable for preliminary review by your colleagues.</li>
  <li><strong>May 6, 2019:</strong> Review assignments will be provided.</li>
  <li><strong>May 16-19, 2019:</strong> Workshop, presentations, and discussions.</li>
  <li><strong>August 1, 2019:</strong> Revised chapters due.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="presentations">Presentations</h2>

<p>There will be three invited keynote lectures, one at the beginning of each of the first three days of the workshop. Keynotes will be scheduled for one hour each, including time for questions and discussion.</p>

<p>Presentations by workshop attendees will be scheduled for <em>30 minutes</em> each, plus an additional 15 minutes for directed discussion. A <em>discussant</em> will be assigned for each presentation from among the attendees, who will have read the paper, who will be given an opportunity to present their own (brief) slide deck as needed.</p>

<p>Time has been set aside for group discussions, retrospectives, follow-ups on speakersâ€™ topics, planning for the current and future proceedings volumes, and so forth, but the schedule is very tight this year, given that we have the Hackathon or more hands-on GP experience on Sunday morning.</p>

<!-- ## Formatting Instructions for Authors

The GPTP 2019 formatting instructions are similar to those of the 2018 edition: We shall work with Springer LaTeX templates. The instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/banzhaf/GPTP-2018-Chapter-Formatting). -->
