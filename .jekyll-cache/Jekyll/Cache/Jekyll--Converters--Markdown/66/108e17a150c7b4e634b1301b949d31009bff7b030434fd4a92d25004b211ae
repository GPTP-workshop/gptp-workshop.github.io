<h2 id="pre-announcement">PRE-ANNOUNCEMENT</h2>

<p>Genetic Programming Theory &amp; Practice is a small, invitation-only workshop hosted 2021 by the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/cscs">Center for the Study of Complex Systems</a> at University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI. This yearâ€™s meeting will be held May 13-14, 2021, in West Hall, rooms 411 (the wood-panelled room on the fourth floor we have traditionally used) and 340 (for initial gathering). West Hall is located at 10085 S. University Ave., Ann Arbor.</p>

<p><em>Note that this yearâ€™s workshop will be *back* in Ann Arbor. This is in line with our decisions from previous meetings to alternate between Ann Arbor and East Lansing. Like last year, we might extend by an additional day compared to earlier sessions, including full days on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, plus a half-day Sunday.</em></p>
