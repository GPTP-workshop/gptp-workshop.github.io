## ANNOUNCEMENT
## The GPTP Workshop 2021 will be held online, Wed 19 to Fri 21, 12:00 pm - 5:00 pm EDT!

Genetic Programming Theory & Practice is a small, invitation-only workshop hosted 2021 by ZOOM. This year's meeting will be held online May 19-21, 2021.
In order to adapt the program to an online framework, we have opted for the following:

(1) Meeting days during the week only

(2) Short meeting days to allow participants to focus

(3) Three keynote presentations at the beginning of each day, followed by discussion

(4) Five to six shorter presentations of contributed papers

(5) Break-out discussions after the contributed talks in small groups

(6) Plenary discussion at the end of each day
