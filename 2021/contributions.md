## GPTP 2021 is held online - Please use Zoom to join in


## Important Dates

- **April 26, 2021:** First drafts of book chapters should be submitted. These need not be formatted, but should be more substantial than an abstract and suitable for preliminary review by your colleagues.
- **April 28, 2021:** Review assignments will be provided.
- **May 19-21, 2021:** Workshop, presentations, and discussions.

## Presentations
**All presentations and interactions will be online through a Zoom link that will be sent to participants by email.**

There are three invited keynote lectures, one at the beginning of each of the three days of the workshop. Keynotes will be scheduled for one hour each, with some
leeway for adding time for questions and discussion.

Presentations by workshop attendees will be scheduled for 10 minutes each, with an additional 5 minutes time for discussion immediately following.

Most time this year has been set aside for group discussions, detailed followups on speakers' topics, and panels.

Due to the online character of the 2021 GPTP Workshop, days will run only from 12 noon to 5 pm EDT. If you are joining from another time zone, please take note of the time difference!

## Proceedings Volume

- **May 15, 2021:** In order to minimize delays with the book coming out of the workshop, we ask contributors to provide their friendly review in writing to the authors of papers they reviewed.
- **August 1, 2021:** Revised papers are due.
- **September 1, 2021:** Submission to Springer Production
- **February 1, 2022:** Anticipated date of publication of the volume

## Formatting Instructions for Authors

The GPTP 2021 formatting instructions are similar to those of earlier editions: We shall work with Springer LaTeX templates. The instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/banzhaf/GPTP-2021-Chapter-Formatting).
