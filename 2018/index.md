Please let us know if you have any dietary restrictions for catered meals.

## Accommodations

[A list of bed-and-breakfast inns, hotels and motels](accommodations.html) will been provided. There are several other options available, including a number of local [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com) providers.

## Meeting Location

The 2018 meeting location will be in the [10th Floor Meeting Space of Weiser Hall](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/weiserhall/) on the University of Michigan Central Campus. Note: _The meeting space cannot be accessed outside of meeting hours._

A (for-fee) parking garage is available nearby (see below).

## Transportation

Flights should be scheduled to the [Detroit Metro Airport](http://www.metroairport.com) (`DTW`). From there, a taxi or [Michigan Flyer/AirRide](http://www.michiganflyer.com) shuttle can be arranged. The Michigan Flyer, in particular, is affordable and convenient.

Unless you are staying directly in Downtown Ann Arbor or the University of Michigan campus area, you will want to to arrange transportation. Rental cars can obtained from the airport, but all major brands also have Ann Arbor locations for pick up and drop off. Several taxi services are available. If you're near a route you can also ride the [excellent local bus service](http://www.theride.org).

There is very little chance of street parking on weekdays on the University campus, but there is a [public parking structure](https://pts.umich.edu/parking/structureforest.php) nearby on Forest Street.
