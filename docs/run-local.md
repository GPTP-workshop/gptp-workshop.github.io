# Running the website locally

Running the website locally is helpful for quickly previewing your changes without needing to push to the remote repository (and wait for GitHub to rebuild the site).
To run this site locally, you'll need to install Jekyll and a few other dependencies.
GitHub has a good step-by-step guide for installation and how to build: <https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll>

Once you have all of the dependencies installed, run

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

in the root directory of this repository to build the site locally and launch a local server to host it.
