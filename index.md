## The GPTP Workshop 2020 has been cancelled due to the Corona virus epidemic. Instead, we plan for 2021! There will be some other activities in the spirit of the GPTP workshop series, all taking place online. Head over to the GPTP Slack channel if you are interested.

## PRE-ANNOUNCEMENT

Genetic Programming Theory & Practice is a small, invitation-only workshop hosted 2021 by the [Center for the Study of Complex Systems](https://lsa.umich.edu/cscs) at University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI. This year's meeting will be held May 13-14, 2021, in West Hall, rooms 411 (the wood-panelled room on the fourth floor we have traditionally used) and 340 (for initial gathering). West Hall is located at 10085 S. University Ave., Ann Arbor.

_Note that this year's workshop will be *back* in Ann Arbor. This is in line with our decisions from previous meetings to alternate between Ann Arbor and East Lansing. Like last year, we might extend by an additional day compared to earlier sessions, including full days on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, plus a half-day Sunday._

## Important Dates

- **May 13-16, 2021:** Workshop, presentations, and discussions

## Food

A light breakfast of pastries, fresh fruit, meats, cream cheese, yoghurt and coffee will be provided each day of the workshop. Mid-day, a lunch will be provided on-site. After the last session each day, attendees typically self-organize for visits to [local restaurants](restaurants.html). Please let us know if you have any dietary restrictions for catered meals.

## Accommodations

[A list of bed-and-breakfast inns, hotels and motels](accommodations.html) is provided. There are several other options available, including a number of local [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com) providers.

## Meeting Location

The 2021 meeting location will be again on the main campus of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. Details are currently being worked out. 

A (for-fee) parking garage is available nearby.

## Transportation

Flights should be scheduled to the [Detroit Metro Airport](http://www.metroairport.com) (`DTW`). From Detroit, the [Michigan Flyer/AirRide](http://www.michiganflyer.com) shuttle can be arranged which is an affordable and convenient mode of transportation to Ann Arbor. Travel time on the bus is about 1 hour. Alternatively, you might want to rent a car at DTW. Transportation options should be considered before actually embarking on the trip.

There is very little chance of street parking on weekdays on the University campus, but there is are a couple of parking garages across campus.
