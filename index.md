### Meeting Location

The 2023 meeting location will be at the Kellogg Hotel and Convention Center, which is located on the west side of the main campus of Michigan State University, located off downtown East Lansing.
A (for-fee) parking garage is available nearby (see below).

### Accommodations

There is a block of rooms reserved at the meeting location, the Kellogg Hotel and Convention Center, which can be booked at a special rate.
Additionally, a list of bed-and-breakfast inns, hotels and motels is provided. There are several other options available, including a number of local AirBnB providers.

### Transportation

Flights should be scheduled to the Detroit Metro Airport (DTW) or to the (closer) Lansing Capital Airport (LAN). From Detroit, the Michigan Flyer/AirRide shuttle can be arranged which is an affordable and convenient mode of transportation to East Lansing. Travel time on the bus is about 2 hours. Alternatively, you might want to rent a car at DTW. From LAN, you could take a taxi or a ride service. Our workshop location, Kellogg Hotel and Convention Center, provides free on site parking for guests.


<!-- Transportation options should be considered before actually embarking on the trip.
There is very little chance of street parking on weekdays on the University campus, but there is a pay-by-use parking close to the College of Engineering. -->
