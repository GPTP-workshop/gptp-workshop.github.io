- Coordination over Facebook is fraught, since there is no guarantee that followers or members of a group will see messages
- Typical response times for email correspondence may be 1--2 days. A [`Mailman` listserv](https://pairlist10.pair.net/mailman/listinfo/gptp2016) has been set up, but we _strongly_ suggest you use the Slack channel instead.
