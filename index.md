### Transportation

Flights should be scheduled to the Detroit Metro Airport (DTW). From Detroit, the Michigan Flyer/AirRide shuttle can be arranged which is an affordable and convenient mode of transportation to Ann Arbor. Travel time on the bus is about 1 hour. Alternatively, you might want to rent a car at DTW.


<!-- Transportation options should be considered before actually embarking on the trip.
There is very little chance of street parking on weekdays on the University campus, but there is a pay-by-use parking close to the College of Engineering. -->
