## Important Dates

- TBD


## Presentations

There are three invited keynote lectures, one at the beginning of each of the three days of the workshop. In general these will be an hour, plus time for questions and discussion.

Presentations by workshop attendees will be about 40 minutes each, plus time for discussion.

Some time has been set aside for group discussions, retrospectives, detailed followups on speakers' topics, planning for the current and future proceedings volumes, and so forth. We will also _try_ to leave an hour for two or three short "lightning" presentations, possibly at the end of one of the sessions, for the communication of new ideas sparked by the workshop itself.

### Tentative schedule

Each day begins at 8:30am, typically with a light breakfast and coffee provided by the University. After brief words from the Organizers and our hosts in CSCS, the first speaker will be one of the Keynote addresses, followed by two presentations in the morning session and two in the afternoon.

The detailed schedule will be published as soon as feasible. If you are a Presenter, having even a tentative title will help us schedule, so please let us know.
