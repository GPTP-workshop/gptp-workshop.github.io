## GPTP 2022 is held in person, at the University of Michigan


## Important Dates

- **April 30, 2022:** First drafts of book chapters should be submitted. These need not be formatted, but should be more substantial than an abstract and suitable for preliminary review by your colleagues.
- **May 1, 2022:** Review assignments will be provided.
- **June 2-4, 2022:** Workshop, presentations, and discussions.

## Presentations
**All presentations and interactions will be in person.**

There are three invited keynote lectures, one at the beginning of each of the three days of the workshop. Keynotes will be scheduled for one hour each, with some
leeway for adding time for questions and discussion. 

Presentations by workshop attendees will be scheduled for 25 minutes each, with an additional 5 minutes time for discussion immediately following.

As usual we shall set aside time this year for group discussions, detailed followups on speakers' topics, and panels.

The main 2022 GPTP Workshop days will run from 9 am to 5 pm EDT. 

## Proceedings Volume

- **June, 2022:** In order to minimize delays with the book coming out of the workshop, we ask contributors to provide their friendly review in writing to the authors of papers they reviewed.  
- **August 1, 2022:** Revised papers are due.
- **September 1, 2022:** Submission to Springer Production
- **February 1, 2023:** Anticipated date of publication of the volume

## Formatting Instructions for Authors

The GPTP 2022 formatting instructions are similar to those of earlier editions: We shall work with Springer LaTeX templates. The instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/banzhaf/GPTP-2021-Chapter-Formatting).
