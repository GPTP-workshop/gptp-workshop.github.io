## COVID Precautions

We shall ask every participant to do a daily COVID test prior to joining the meeting in the morning. Free antigene test sets will be available at the meeting venue. We shall ask everybody to wear a mask during the meeting, except when unavoidable. Please consult the [CDC Guidelines for COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html?s_cid=11759:cdc%20covid%20guidelines:sem.ga:p:RG:GM:gen:PTN:FY22) in regard to current rules and recommendations.
