## Important Dates

- **May 1, 2017:** First drafts of book chapters should be submitted. These need not be formatted, but should be more substantial than an abstract and suitable for preliminary review by your colleagues.
- **May 3, 2017:** Review assignments will be provided.
- **May 18-20, 2017:** Workshop, presentations, and discussions.

## Presentations

There are three invited keynote lectures, one at the beginning of each of the three days of the workshop. Keynotes will be scheduled for one hour each, including time for questions and discussion.

Presentations by workshop attendees will be scheduled for 45 minutes each, including time for discussion.

Some time has been set aside for group discussions, retrospectives, detailed followups on speakers' topics, planning for the current and future proceedings volumes, and so forth.

We will also _try_ to leave an hour for two or three short "lightning" presentations, possibly at the end of one of the sessions, for the communication of new ideas sparked by the workshop itself.

## Proceedings Volume

- **June 1, 2017:** In order to minimize delays with the book coming out of the workshop, we ask contributors to provide their friendly review in writing to the authors of papers they reviewed.
- **August 1, 2017:** Revised papers are due.
- **September 1, 2017:** Submission to Springer Production
- **March 1, 2018:** Anticipated date of publication of the volume

## Formatting Instructions for Authors

The GPTP 2017 formatting instructions are similar to those of the 2016 edition: We shall work with Springer LaTeX templates. The instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/banzhaf/GPTP-2017-Chapter-Formatting).
